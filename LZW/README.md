# LZW
This is a Java implementation of the LZW compression algorythm.

---

### About
As mentioned above the algorythm is written in Java.\
As of now, the compression starts with a creation of a standard dictionary instead of using the ASCII-Table as the standard dictionary. This will be fixed when decompression is added to the code.

### Status
It is not complete as it lacks a (correct) decompression feature, cleaned up code, classes and comments in its code.\
All of these issues are going to be fixed. For a complete overview of the project status please refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/lkirstein/compression/blob/main/README.md) of the repository.
